# Date and Timing

The 2022 OYMC will be held in July, similar to last year. Specific dates and timing are still being discussed. 

# Format of Competition

Unlike last year, the 2022 OYMC Summer will consist of one overall individual round for the Middle School division as well as the Elementary Division (with the ES Division being easier than the MS). The test will consist of 15 questions in increasing difficulty order. 

- Elementary School Division: 15 Questions, 60 Minutes, Mathcounts School / Early AMC8 to Late AMC8 / Mid AMC10

- Middle School Division: 15 Questions, 60 Minutes, Early AMC10 to Late AIME

During the competition, all students will be emailed both the test and a submission form. The test will also be published on this website and on AoPS. Students are given a 5 minute window for internet delays, loading the test file, submitting, etc. Once time is up, the submission form will be closed and at that point, **any student who has not submitted their answers in time will not be able to submit their answers and will receive a 0**. Therefore it is crucial that students submit a little bit before time is over (thus utilizing the 5 minute window given).

Students will be notified of their results shortly after, and they will be emailed out, published on our website, and published on AoPS. Prizes will then follow in the following week. 

# General Rules

All rules will be emailed to students participating, and they will also be included on the cover page of the test.
